# Financial Document Analysis and Question Answering System
Implemented a comprehensive system for analyzing financial documents using Python, OCR, and NLP techniques. Extracted text from PDFs, preprocessed data by removing noise and stopwords, and employed a retrieval-based question answering (QA) system using transformers and FAISS. Developed visualizations such as word clouds and word frequency plots to provide insights into financial data.
